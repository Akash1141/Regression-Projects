# Regression-Projects
In this project, we successfully developed a predictive model to forecast daily sales for Rossmann drug stores. By leveraging machine learning techniques and analyzing historical sales data, we aimed to improve the accuracy of sales predictions compared to individual store managers' estimates.

Throughout the project, we followed a structured approach, starting with data preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Categorical variables were encoded to numerical representations, and feature engineering techniques were applied to extract relevant information. Exploratory data analysis provided valuable insights into the relationships between variables, uncovering patterns and trends.

For model development, we trained and evaluated three different regression models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression. We utilized appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the accuracy of the sales forecasts. Additionally, we performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models' performance and selected the best performing model based on the evaluation metrics.

The selected model demonstrated improved accuracy in predicting sales compared to the current approach of individual store managers. By considering various factors such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality, the model was able to generate more reliable sales forecasts. The evaluation metric score charts highlighted the improvement achieved by the model, indicating its potential for positive business impact.

The feature importance analysis provided insights into the factors that significantly influenced sales. By prioritizing these features, businesses can make informed decisions, allocate resources effectively, and optimize their strategies to drive better business outcomes. The model's explainability using tools like Permutation Importance further enhanced our understanding of the features' contributions to the predictions.

Overall, the developed predictive model holds promising potential for Rossmann drug stores to improve their sales forecasting accuracy. By leveraging this model, store managers can make data-driven decisions, optimize inventory management, and plan promotions more effectively. This will ultimately lead to better resource allocation, increased profitability, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

As with any predictive model, it is important to continually monitor its performance and retrain it with new data as it becomes available. Regular updates and refinements to the model can further enhance its accuracy and ensure its continued relevance and value to the business.

In conclusion, this project showcases the power of data science and machine learning in improving sales forecasting for Rossmann drug stores. By leveraging historical sales data and advanced modeling techniques, businesses can gain valuable insights, make informed decisions, and drive positive business outcomes.
